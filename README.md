## The problem
In a game there are three doors, and only one door has prize, the others are empty. You can randomly choose a door, let's say door #1, then a bystander will open one door (let'say door #2) from the rest of the two doors that you didn't choose. If the bystander opened a empty one, would you like to swith to the door #3? Or in another word, does the winning prize chance increases when you switching to the door #3? The answer is NO. BUT, some people instist that the switching does has the bigger chance of winning prize. Here is their reasoning.
As shown in the diagram, totally cases of how the prize can distribute is all listed out. So people think that when you choose one door, thus you only has one case (i.e. 1/3 probability) to win the prize (case 1), while the two cases (i.e. 2/3 probability) of winning is in the rest of doors. Thus when one of the rest doors is empty, the total 2/3 probability  directly shifted to the other door. This is NOT CORRECT because people are changing the problem here. The original question is based on "facing a switching situtation, do you need to switch", think about it, when the opened door #2 is already a prize, do you need to consider swithing to #3? No, there is no prize for you for sure! You have to exclude these no-need to choose situation from the full random cases. To calculate the probability of this problem correctly, you need to make sure the denominator is the times of facing choice situation, and the numberator of winning with the original door is the times of orignal door has prize and you have to face the choice, and the numerator of wining with swithing has to be the times of the prize in switing door when you have to face the choice. 
Back to our simple example here in the diagram. Yes, in generally pure random situations, the case1 only has 1/3 probability, and case2+case3 takes 2/3 probability. But they are not creating switching problem equally. In case1, bystander open either door #2 or #3 will both bring you to a swithing problem, while in case2, bystander need to open door #3 NOT door #2, and in case3, bystander need to open door #2 NOT #3 to bring you to the switching. You see now, case1 happens you 100% goes to switching occasion, while case2+case3 together do has more probabily of showing, but each of them only has half chance of bring you to the switching occasion. So now think about it again, you want to know, when you facing the switcing door problem, do you need to switch? When you facing the problem, the background distribution is different from case1, case2, case3 independly show up, it's  case1 shows up or case2 shows up with door #3 open, and case3 shows up with door #2 open. That's why I am saying the denominator should be the total times you are facing the swithcing situation. 

And here is the code accordingly to simulate the situation, you can run it with parameters "times" means how many times you want to simulate the cases, and it will calculate the total times of the switching problem you have to face, and then calculate switching and non swtiching probability when you facing the switching problem. And it's the same. Also another parameter is n, which is how many doors you want to set up. You can set more than 3 doors, the rule is the same: you choose one door, and the bystander open the rest of the doors and only left one door, and during the opening process, if prize shows up in one of the doors, NO switching situation exist (you lose the prize already), the total times of swithing situation add one only when, all the opened doors are empty. You will find that the probability is the same.

## Run the code
```bash
python monty_simulation.py --n 5 --times 100000
```
